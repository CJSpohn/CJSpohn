### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Spohn and I am a frontend web developer who has discovered a passion for data visualization. I absolutely love learning new technologies and have spent the past 7 months learning web development at the Turing School of Software and Design.

Here's a unique visualization of my GitHub profile! What is this? Check out my projects below to learn more!
